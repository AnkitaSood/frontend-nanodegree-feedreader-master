# Project Overview

The project can be viewed live [here](http://ankitasood.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader-master/). This project has [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) test suites incorporated in order to make sure that all the RSS feeds requested return at least one feed, with no empty url, and are different from one another. Tests have also been written to make sure the menu is hidden by default and expands/ collapses whenever the hamburger icon is clicked.
